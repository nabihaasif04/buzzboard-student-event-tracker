The SQL queries provide valuable insights into the Buzzboard event management system, 
revealing that tech-related events like the Python Workshop and AI Innofest are actively registered for, 
with some students participating in multiple events. 
The system effectively tracks event popularity through registration counts, identifies the most upcoming event date, and distinguishes between overlapping and exclusive attendees for different events.
Organizers can analyze student engagement patterns, such as which events have multiple registrations or which students registered for one event but not another,
enabling data-driven decisions for future event planning and targeted promotions. 
The database successfully maps relationships between students, events, and organizers, offering a comprehensive view of participation trends and event performance.
